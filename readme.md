Phoenix 

This is my playground for game engine development and research. 
I work on this is in my free time, so the progress is going to be slow.
In the long run, I'm working towards implementing a small game idea I have, so basically any features I need for that I build here.
Unless I deem it to be too much work, or not interesting, I try to build as much as possible from scratch.
