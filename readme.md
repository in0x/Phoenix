Phoenix Engine

This goal of this project is to build a 3D game engine for first person games basically from scratch. The end game is to use the engine to create a clone of a certain free running game by DICE.

Reasoning:

1: Why build your own? Why not use engine xyz? 

I strongly believe that the best way to learn something is to simply do it. Since I'd like to get into engine development once I'm done with my studies, I couldn't think of a better learning project than building my own.

I also really enjoy getting into the nitty gritty of the systems behind games, so at this point, building my       own engine was the logical next step for me. Of course I understand that this is not the most efficient way to a build game, but the goal of this project is to actually build an engine, not build a game to sell.
	   
2: Still, why an entire engine? Why not build something simpler?

At this point I have built games from scratch in multiple languages, using Unity and UE4. Each time I completed a project, I came out a better developer. Game engines are such massive beasts, they require a vast amount of knowledge in many areas, from domain specific knowledge in math or Sound to more general SE skills like API design. Actually building forces me to gain knowledge in all these areas.
